### Git Workshop

Hello ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to Git Workshop. It's a very simple repository containing the basics of Git, some theory, good practices and exercises.
Hope you'll learn something new and enjoy whatever it is that you find here âœ¨
**This is a change from Patri**

### What is Git?
Git is a version control system allowing for users to share their work (in most cases - programming) and publish it, a collaboration tool.
Git works using hashes in a key-value form to save every action taken on the software. Every object has it's hash value, which Git uses to navigate to whenever a change is made.
The structure resembles a tree ðŸŒ³ Additionally, each user has it's own copy of the repository on their local machine (contrary to an SVN system).
Another big difference between git and other version control systems is access to the local history. In most cases you don't need to change your history of the files, however
it's permitted.
Git generally isn't a good place for storing big files (you can, however use the [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/))

#### Branches
As mentioned before, git has a tree-like structure ðŸŒ³ it operates on branches, which can be merged/rebased/pulled from/pushed into whatever you need.

#### Common Misconceptions
1. You will break the git repository with one push - that's not true. Git is easy to learn, but hard to master. For one push to destroy the whole repository, well... that requires a lot of skill.
2. You only commit when the feature is production-ready - think of commits as more of 'updates' on the process.
3. Merge/rebasing is scary - unless you're using *force push* then everything will be alright.

#### Basic Commands
1. Add -> stage a change. Never use `git add . `, as you could potentially stage files that are not supposed to be changed or added. Be careful when adding whole directories too, as it adds *every* file in said directory. For example, if somebody wanted to push a picture of a graph, you should use `git add pictures/graph.png`, otherwise it might add files like `funny_picure.png`, `my_moms_dinner.png`...
2. Commit -> commit staged changes. Remember to use proper messages to commit!
3. Push -> push commited changes
4. Rebase -> when working as an internal collabolator; moves entire changes to the branchs' HEAD; changes the history!
5. Merge -> similarly to rebase, but doesn't change the history nor any of the existing branches.
6. Checkout -> to switch a branch
7. Status -> see the current status of repository to let you monitor which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git
8. Stash -> stashes changes for later use
9. Fetch -> saves changes from a remote repository without applying them with checkout/pull
10. Restore -> restores a file from changes made on it.

#### Remote vs Origin
*Remote* is a repository on a server.
*Origin* is your local version, stored on the device.

You can add to remote (if you're workng on forks for instance) by using `git remote add <name> <url>`.

### Exercises:
1. Fork this repository
  * Make a branch
  * Make some changes
  * Stage your changes 
  * Commit those changes
  * Create a PR
  * Request a review from a user djagoda881
2. Clone the repository
  * Make a branch
  * Make some changes
  * Stage your changes 
  * Commit those changes
  * Create a PR
  * Mark me as a reviewer a user djagoda881
#### For engineering team 
3. Pull a branch from forked repository of the person on yor right
4. Make some changes and push them to branch from 3.
